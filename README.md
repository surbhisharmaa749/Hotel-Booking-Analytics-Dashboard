## 📊 Hotel Booking Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to understand booking patterns, cancellation behavior, revenue trends, and customer segmentation in the hospitality domain.

The dashboard focuses on weekday vs weekend behavior, booking lead time, booking channels, and loyalty segmentation to support data-driven decision-making in hotel operations.

This project was built as part of my learning journey in Power BI, focusing on Power Query, DAX measures, and interactive dashboard design.
