📊 Hotel Booking Analysis Dashboard

📖 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze hotel booking data and uncover insights related to booking patterns, cancellation behavior, revenue trends, and customer segmentation in the hospitality domain.

The dashboard focuses on weekday vs weekend behavior, booking lead time, booking channels, and loyalty segmentation to support data-driven operational and managerial decision-making.

📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset represents a simulated real-world hotel booking environment and includes the following attributes:
Booking Date
Stay Date
Booking Channel
Customer Loyalty Level
Booking Status
Number of Nights
Room Rate
Revenue

The dataset is designed to reflect typical hotel reservation scenarios used in hospitality analytics.

📈 Key KPIs

The following KPIs were created using DAX in Power BI:
Booking Count
Total Revenue
Average Room Rate (ADR)
Total Room Nights
Cancellation Count
Cancellation Percentage
Loyalty-based Booking Counts
Single-night and Multi-night Booking Counts

🔍 Key Insights

1. Weekday bookings account for a higher share of total booking volume, while weekends remain strategically important.
2. Cancellation rates vary across customer segments, with non-members showing relatively higher cancellation behavior.
3. Loyalty members contribute a larger share of total bookings compared to non-members.
4. A large portion of bookings are made within one week of the stay, indicating last-minute booking behavior.
5. Direct hotel bookings and connected wholesalers generate the highest booking volumes across channels.
